Development
===========

Releasing
---------

.. code:: console

   % pip install --upgrade build twine
   % python -m build --sdist --wheel
   % twine check dist/*
   % twine upload dist/*

Versioning
----------

We use ``bumpver`` to increment all of our version strings. This removes the
common headaches around trying to write the version string once and
simultaneously avoid cyclical imports. It also automates versioning non-Python
sources.

To increment manually:

.. code:: console

    % bumpver update --set-version="1.1.0"

You can also test first:

.. code:: console

    % bumpver update --dry --set-version="1.1.0"

And you can even try to leave it to ``bumpver`` to decide your new version number,
but incrementing only one part of the version:

.. code:: console

    % bumpver update --patch
